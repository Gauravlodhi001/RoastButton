Here is a professional, fun, and ready-to-use **README.md** for your GitHub repository. I've designed it to look great on your profile, with a touch of the "roast" personality included.

## 📖 About

The Roast Button is a React-based interactive web application designed to humble you. It starts as a simple button that dispenses coding and gaming-themed roasts when clicked. 

However, if you click it too many times, the button enters "Rage Mode". It turns red, shakes, and uses physics-based animations to actively dodge your mouse cursor, making it nearly impossible to click. If you do manage to catch it... well, you'll have to see.

## ✨ Features

- 🔥 Savage Roasts: A curated list of insults targeting developers, gamers, and your life choices.
- 🏃‍♂️ Dodge Mechanics:The button uses `framer-motion` to run away from your cursor when it gets annoyed.
- 😡 Rage Mode: Visual feedback (shaking, color changes) when the interaction limit is reached.
- 🎉 Victory Effects: If you have the aim of a god and catch the button, you get a confetti celebration.
- 🎨 Modern UI: Sleek, dark-mode design using Tailwind CSS.

💡 Pro Tip for your GitHub:
Since this is a visual project, I highly recommend taking a screenshot or recording a small GIF of the button running away and placing it right under the "About" section. It makes the repository look 10x better!
